# Inferno Collection: Vehicle Whitelist
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Vehicle-Whitelist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Vehicle-Whitelist)

__Public Beta Version 1.1__

Allows server owners to place vehicles into predefined whitelists in the config, which will then require the respective password in-game before players can enter these vehicles. Passwords are set in the server file. Please note, that for players to enter a vehicle they have not got the password to, such as a suspect getting into a Police Car, they will need to be placed in the vehicle via an external script.

Presently, the following can be customized:
- Which vehicles are in which whitelist.
- The passwords for each whitelist
- Adding and removing vehicle lists
